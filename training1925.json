You ignore them???? Delete and think, thank God I am not living in Iran? This does not happen in my world ....\n\nBut the world is OURS - whether we live in Portugal, Sweden or in Iran. OUR children grow up in this world.\n\nI feel helpless but I don\u00b4t want to think I received these pictures for no reason. Therefore, let\u00b4s use the power of the computer and internet to spread the information around the world.

in the canine population of the U.S.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe New Canine Influenza, Greyhound Disease, Race Flu, Equine Influenza, Avian Flu\n\nThe New Canine Flu, which has killed so many greyhounds, is now in the domestic dog population. There is no treatment and no vaccine. It has jumped species, (by feeding greyhounds raw horse meat, which was infected with horse influenza), (horse influenza is avian flu, which jumped species from birds (avian flu), to horses (horse influenza). The avian flu has now moved to racing greyhounds and domestic dogs and the indications are that there may be a potential problem for humans. It is deadly and it is on the loose. It may just be a matter of time. The CDC is watching the disease.\n\nThere is no central tracking agency with report and stat capability for dogs that will get the word out to all vets in the US.\n\n\nThe domestic dog population is at present risk.\n\nThis week on my net groups I saw many anecdotal accounts of $100,000 show dogs dying while packed in ice and hooked up to IVs, with high temps. No one knows what is wrong with these dogs and the vets do not know what they are treating. I think it is Greyhound Influenza or Race Flu.\n\nShow populations are now infected and the majority of veterinarians have never heard of the disease. Isolated individuals know this but the country as a whole does not. A few days after exposure at dog shows, dogs are traveling back to their home states and infecting the local populations. Many dogs are dying needlessly. It is not kennel cough.\n\nThe period of incubation is 2-5 days. It is airborne, can be transmitted by inanimate objects, and clothing. Virtually all exposed will contract. The morbidity is 80% with 20% being sub clinically affected and shedding the virus. The course of the disease is four weeks. There are two forms, milder and very extreme. Two weeks into the viral disease the dog looks like he is getting over the cough and then bacterial infections become an acute problem. Oft times the owner has reported the dog is well, only to find that a short time later an acute bacterial infection has taken over the dog, in a matter of hours. The owners think the disease has run its course only to learn it hasn't gotten started yet, so dogs are dying needlessly.\n\nMy vet thinks earlier rather than later treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics are the best way to treat the disease. With proper vet care perhaps there will only be a mortality of 1-5%.\n\nThe information needs to go out so that all vets will know this is not kennel cough, so they will not VAX for kennel cough while ill, and so they can monitor beyond the two week period.\n\nIt has been almost impossible for me to understand how in the last four days i have contacted state vets who have never heard of the new influenza, all the while, the people with the info on the disease, refuse to release it nationally.\n\nThe AVMA has info that will go out next month. How many will die prior to that? I have begged and cajoled them to do this, so perhaps we are making some headway, however, we need info to go out ASAP.\n\nAPHIS says it is not their job.\n\nThe people who are handling research on the initial outbreak in FLA., are contacting local, (FLA) BUT not national sources to disseminate information.\n\nBelow is a link to a photo album in which i placed the FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory, which was put out by the FLA VET MED ASSOC., at the request of the State Vet. It is not on the state website.\n\nhttp://photobucket.com/albums/y249/citycolumbus/\n\nIn my conversations with the researchers at the U. of FLA. I was told, by the lead researcher, who owns greyhounds, that they have no responsibility to provide this info to other states or to other vets. (BTW, Is some of the research funded by the gaming organizations?) (My state, GA., the state of FLA., and three highly placed individuals at Pfizer, told me to call the researcher.) The researcher said to me that cultures do not need to be done on potential affecteds, and she denied that the illness is from horses, though she is quoted in articles as applauding the Cornell researcher who identified it as horse influenza. The FLA state vet said: \"We know it came from horses.\"\n\nThe researcher is working to do a contracted vaccine with \" a company.\" She is working on a paper. She did not want to discuss the influenza though her name, email and number appears as the contact source on the state of FLA Veterinary Alert and Advisory that went out to all FLA vets. I was told by some at Pfizer that Pfizer is not the company who is helping her develop the vaccine.\n\nThe researcher said the FLA VETERINARY ALERT AND ADVISORY should not be put on the net. However the FLA state Vet, Dr. Thomas Holt, told me, on Fri., Sept 16, 2005 to put it on the net...\"Feel free to use it.\"\n\nMany state vets who do not know anything at all about this illness even though the state of FLA. put out memos on the influenza in August 05 in the state of FLA., without notifying other states.\n\nIf the researchers are correct there will be a national epidemic. When a disease is in a mobile population an epidemic is possible. Large groupings of dogs, such as shows, kennels, rescues, etc., are at risk.\n\nMost vets across the country have never heard of the disease. A treatment protocol has not been developed. They are treating it as if it is kennel cough. All vets need to be informed about it ASAP! Many of us concerned dog people would like to see state statistics compiled on the illness and the eventual treatment outcomes.\n\nFolks, this is one of the many new problems we are seeing from feeding raw meat to dogs. Please do not do it.\n\u00a0\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Collected on the Internet, 2005": [], "The FBI arrested 22 employees of the Clinton Foundation on the first day of an

It is all over the net. These sites include commentary on what the executive order is for and what it does. If this is the truth, I'm scared to think about it. Most of the past presidents have allegedly signed around 30 of them. At the end of the day an executive order circumvents the congress and senate. Fill in the blanks. Someone credible needs to research and report on this.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10990 allows the government to take over all modes of transportation and control of highways and seaports.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10995 allows the government to seize and control the communication media.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10997 allows the government to take over all electrical power, gas, petroleum, fuels and minerals.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 10998 allows the government to take over all food resources and farms.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11000 allows the government to mobilize civilians into work brigades under government supervision.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11001 allows the government to take over all health, education and welfare functions.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11002 designates the Postmaster General to operate a national registration of all persons.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11003 allows the government to take over all airports and aircraft, including commercial aircraft.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11004 allows the Housing and Finance Authority to relocate communities, build new housing with public funds, designate areas to be abandoned, and establish new locations for populations.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11005 allows the government to take over railroads, inland waterways and public storage facilities.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11049 assigns emergency preparedness function to federal departments and agencies, consolidating 21 operative Executive Orders issued over a fifteen year period.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11051 specifies the responsibility of the Office of Emergency Planning and gives authorization to put all Executive Orders into effect in times of increased international tensions and economic or financial crisis.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11310 grants authority to the Department of Justice to enforce the plans set out in Executive Orders, to institute industrial support, to establish judicial and legislative liaison, to control all aliens, to operate penal and correctional institutions, and to advise and assist the President.\n\n-EXECUTIVE ORDER 11921 allows the Federal Emergency Preparedness Agency to develop plans to establish control over the mechanisms of production and distribution, of energy sources, wages, salaries, credit and the flow of money in U.S. financial institution in any undefined national emergency. It also provides that when a state of emergency is declared by the President, Congress cannot review the action for six months.\n\nFeel free to verify the \"executive orders\" at will ... and these are just the major ones ...\n\nTeddy Roosevelt: 3\nOthers Prior To FDR: NONE\nFDR: 11 in 16 years\nTruman: 5 in 7 years\nIke: 2 in 8 years\nJFK: 4 in 3 years\nLBJ: 4 in 5 years\nNixon: 1 in 6 years\nFord: 3 in 2 years\nCarter: 3 in 4 years\nReagan: 5 in 8 years\nBush 1: 3 in 4 years\nClinton: 15 in 8 years\nBush 2: 62 in 8 years\nObama: 923 in 3+ years!\n\nDuring my lifetime, all Presidents have issued Executive Orders, for reasons that vary, some more than others.\n\nWhen a President issued as many as 30 Executive Orders during a term in Office, people thought there was something amiss.\n\nWHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT 923 EXECUTIVE ORDERS IN ONE PART OF ONE TERM?????? YES, THERE IS A REASON.\n\nIT IS THAT THE PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO TAKE CONTROL AWAY FROM THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE.\n\nEven some Democrats in the House have turned on him, plus a very small number of Democrat Senators question him.\n\nHE SHOULD BE QUESTIONED. WHAT IS HE REALLY TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH????\n\nDOES THIS SCARE YOU AS MUCH AS IT DOES ME?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, September 2012": [], "A video documents that The

microchips.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nObamacare law requires an RFID chip implanted in all of us.\n\nAre you ready to have your RFID Chip Implanted? 3/23/2013 is your date!\n\nThis new Health Care (Obamacare) law requires an RFID chip implanted in all of us. This chip will not only contain your personal information with tracking capability but it will also be linked to your bank account. And get this, Page 1004 of the new law (dictating the timing of this chip), reads, and I quote: \"Not later than 36 months after the date of the enactment\". It is now the law of the land that by March 23rd 2013 we will all be required to have an RFID chip underneath our skin and this chip will be link to our bank accounts as well as have our personal records and tracking capability built into it...\"\n\n\n\nSeems people will be getting more than they bargained for in this new health care bill.\n\nThe Obama health care bill under Sec. 2521, page 1,000 will establish a National Medical Device Registry. What does a National Medical Device Registry mean?\n\nNational Medical Device Registry from H.R. 3200 [Healthcare Bill], pages 1,001-1,008:\n(g)(1) The Secretary shall establish a national medical device registry (in this subsection referred to as the 'registry') to facilitate analysis of postmarket safety and outcomes data on each device that:\n\n(A) is or has been used in or on a patient;\n(B) and is:\n\u00a0 \u00a0 (i) a class III device;\n\n\u00a0 &nbsp or (ii) a class II device that is implantable, life-supporting, or life-sustaining.\nA \"class II device that is implantable?\"\n\nThen on page 1,004 it describes what the term \"data\" means in paragraph 1, section B: \"(B) In this paragraph, the term 'data' refers to in formation respecting a device described in paragraph (1), including claims data, patient survey data, standardized analytic files that allow for the pooling and analysis of data from disparate data environments, electronic health records, and any other data deemed appropriate by the Secretary.\"\n\nApproved by the FDA, a class II implantable device is a \"implantable radiofrequency transponder system for patient identification and health information.\"\n\nThis sort of device would be implanted in the majority of people who opt to become covered by the public health care option. With the reform of the private insurance companies, who charge outrageous rates, many people will switch their coverage to a more affordable insurance plan. This means the number of people who choose the public option will increase. This also means the number of people chipped will be plentiful as well. The adults who choose to have a chip implanted are the lucky (yes, lucky if you're a Govt Control Libtard) ones in this case. Children who are \"born in the United States who at the time of birth is not otherwise covered under acceptable coverage\" will be qualified and placed into the CHIP or Children's Health Insurance Program (what a convenient name). With a name like CHIP it would seem consistent to have the chip implanted into a child. Children conceived by parents who are already covered under the public option will more than likely be implanted with a chip by the consent of the parent. Eventually everyone will be implanted with a chip. And with the price and coverage of the public option being so competitive with the private companies, the private company may not survive.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via the

Foxworthy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA Country Founded by Geniuses but Run by Idiots\n\nAttributed to Jeff Foxworthy:\n\nIf you can get arrested for hunting or fishing without a license, but not for entering and remaining in the country illegally \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf you have to get your parents\u2019 permission to go on a field trip or to take an aspirin in school, but not to get an abortion \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf you MUST show your identification to board an airplane, cash a check, buy liquor, or check out a library book and rent a video, but not to vote for who runs the government \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf the government wants to prevent stable, law-abiding citizens from owning gun magazines that hold more than ten rounds, but gives twenty F-16 fighter jets to the crazy new leaders in Egypt \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf, in the nation\u2019s largest city, you can buy two 16-ounce sodas, but not one 24-ounce soda, because 24-ounces of a sugary drink might make you fat \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf an 80-year-old woman or a three-year-old girl who is confined to a wheelchair can be strip-searched by the TSA at the airport, but a woman in a burka or a hijab is only subject to having her neck and head searched \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf your government believes that the best way to eradicate trillions of dollars of debt is to spend trillions more \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf a seven-year-old boy can be thrown out of school for saying his teacher is \"cute,\" but hosting a sexual exploration or diversity class in\ngrade school is perfectly acceptable \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf hard work and success are met with higher taxes and more government regulation and intrusion, while not working is rewarded with Food Stamps, WIC checks, Medicaid benefits, subsidized housing, and free cell phones \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf the government\u2019s plan for getting people back to work is to provide incentives for not working, by granting 99 weeks of unemployment checks, without any requirement to prove that gainful employment was diligently sought, but couldn\u2019t be found \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf you pay your mortgage faithfully, denying yourself the newest big-screen TV, while your neighbor buys iPhones, time shares, a wall-sized do-it-all plasma screen TV and new cars, and the government forgives his debt when he defaults on his mortgage \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nIf being stripped of your Constitutional right to defend yourself makes you more \"safe\" according to the government \u2014 you might live in a nation that was founded by geniuses but is run by idiots.\n\nWhat a country!\n\nHow about we give God a reason to continue blessing America!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, January 2013": [], "\"Tax

It did to me.\n\nSo I looked up a bit about Chelsea's new apt.:\nTHE WHITMAN, 21 EAST 26TH STREET, 4 - FLATIRON DISTRICT, NEW YORK\n\nI discovered that it exactly shares an address with:\n\nMETROCARE HOME SERVICES, INC.\n21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl\nNew York, NY 10010\n\nSAME address..SAME Floor...only One Apt. per floor.\n\nFor a woman very secretive about her ambiguous medical conditions...whom avoids hospitals like the plague, it occurred to me that when the Clinton's bought this incredibly expensive apt. for their daughter in 2013...they may have also purchased it with the intent of using it as a secret private medical treatment facility for Hillary to use during her anticipated campaign.\n\nTo the press...it would only appear Hillary was just dropping in for a visit with her daughter...when, in reality, she is receiving medical treatment and controlled substances from private physicians and private pharmacists...on private property (no need for disclosure).\n\nIf so, Chelsea's apt. served it's secret purpose flawlessly this Sunday.\n\nIt makes sense that to establish a clandestine medical treatment facility in a residential apartment--one which is legally compliant with the controlled substances dispensing/stocking/delivery & shipping requirements...and one which is able to legally supply and treat a private patient with the drugs needed, one would also have to register the address as a medical treatment facility.\n\nIn this case, I would assume the Clinton Foundation would be the controlling entity.\n\nA staff (and private) doctor or pharmacist would then be employed (Hillary has two) to legally treat the patient, practice medicine within the confines of the private residence...and dispense drugs to that private patient without any disclosure.\n\nThis sham medical facility, while legally registered as a public care facility...would also have to be closed to the public in order to operate without any disclosure.\n\nTHIS is exactly what appears to be taking place at 21 East 26th Street, 4th Fl., New York, NY.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Facebook, September 2016": [], "With the Trump tax law, \"70

of 2010-2014, the federal government knowingly injected mothers with a  vaccine mixed in an anesthetic shot known as an Epidural. What was that vaccine? Well according to Henry Rothschild, (no relation to the Rothschild family allegedly) the vaccine is known as Terminar.\n\nTerminar which is Spanish for terminate, according to Mr. Rothschild Terminar was design to break down African American/Black women ovaries exposing them to different germs and multiple diseases which will likely produce a child with serious birth defects and serious illnesses.\n\nThe government ran a secret operation releasing the anesthetic to predominately black areas. They figure it was best to distribute it through an Epidural so it will go unnoticed. Mr. Rothschild child is asking both black and white women to find out what illnesses may run in your family. If you received an Epidural between 2010-2014 and later gave birth anywhere from 2011 until present, if your child was born with any illness that's not normal this may be the reason why.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, October 2016": [], " Claimed that \"we were one vote away from repealing\u201d Obamacare.

Can you believe the nerve of these people? It's almost funny. The State of Sonora is angry at the influx of Mexicans into Mexico. Nine state legislators from the Mexican State of Sonora traveled to Tucson to complain about Arizona's new employer crackdown on illegals from Mexico.\n\nIt seems that many Mexican illegals are returning to their hometowns and the officials in the Sonora state government are ticked off.\n \nA delegation of nine state legislators from Sonora was in Tucson on Tuesday to state that Arizona's new Employer Sanctions Law will have a devastating effect on the Mexican state.\n\nAt a news conference, the legislators said that Sonora \u2014 Arizona's southern neighbor, made up of mostly small towns \u2014 cannot handle the demand for housing, jobs and schools that it will face as Mexican workers return to their hometowns from the USA without jobs or money.\n\n\nThe Arizona law, which took effect Jan. 1, punishes Arizona employers who knowingly hire individuals without valid legal documents to work in the United States. Penalties include suspension of, or loss of, their business license.\n\nThe Mexican legislators are angry because their own citizens are returning to their hometowns, placing a burden on THEIR state government. 'How can Arizona pass a law like this?' asked Mexican Rep Leticia Amparano-Gamez, who represents Nogales.\n\n'There is not one person living in Sonora who does not have a friend or relative working in Arizona,' she said, speaking in Spanish. 'Mexico is not prepared for this, for the tremendous problems it will face as more and more Mexicans working in Arizona and who were sending money to their families return to their home-towns in Sonora without jobs,' she said. 'We are one family, socially and economically,' she said of the people of Sonora and Arizona.\n\nWrong!\n\nThe United States is a sovereign nation, not a subsidiary of Mexico, and its taxpayers are not responsible for the welfare of Mexico's citizens.\n\nIt's time for the Mexican government, and its citizens, to stop feeding parasitically off the United States and to start taking care of its/their own needs.\n\n\nToo bad that other states within the USA don't pass a law just like that passed by Arizona .\n\nMaybe that's the answer, since our own Congress will do nothing! \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via Email, May 2008": [], "\"In 45 out of 50 states, on average men are seeing their premiums double, going up 99 percent.

for the body to absorb it properly.\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSee\u00a0Example(s)\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nEATING FRUIT\nWe all think eating fruits means just buying fruits, cutting it and just popping it into our mouths. It's not as easy as you think. It's important to know how and when to eat.\n\nWhat is the correct way of eating fruits?\n\nIT MEANS NOT EATING FRUITS AFTER YOUR MEALS! * FRUITS SHOULD BE EATEN ON AN EMPTY STOMACH.\n\nIf you eat fruit like that, it will play a major role to detoxify your system, supplying you with a great deal of energy for weight loss and other life activities.\n\nFRUIT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FOOD.\n\nLet's say you eat two slices of bread and then a slice of fruit. The slice of fruit is ready to go straight through the stomach into the intestines, but it is prevented from doing so.\n\nIn the meantime the whole meal rots and ferments and turns to acid. The minute the fruit comes into contact with the food in the stomach and digestive juices, the entire mass of food begins to spoil.\n\nSo please eat your fruits on an empty stomach or before your meals! You have heard people complaining - every time I eat water-melon I burp, when I eat durian my stomach bloats up, when I eat a banana I feel like running to the toilet etc - actually all this will not arise if you eat the fruit on an empty stomach. The fruit mixes with the putrefying other food and\nproduces gas and hence you will bloat!\n\nGraying hair, balding, nervous outburst, and dark circles under the eyes all these will not happen if you take fruits on an empty stomach.\n\nThere is no such thing as some fruits, like orange and lemon are acidic, because all fruits become alkaline in our body, according to Dr. Herbert Shelton who did research on this matter. If you have mastered the correct way of eating fruits, you have the Secret of beauty, longevity, health, energy, happiness and normal weight.\n\nWhen you need to drink fruit juice - drink only fresh fruit juice, NOT from the cans. Don't even drink juice that has been heated up. Don't eat cooked fruits because you don't get the nutrients at all. You only get to taste. Cooking destroys all the vitamins.\n\nBut eating a whole fruit is better than drinking the juice. If you should drink the juice, drink it mouthful by mouthful slowly, because you must let it mix with your saliva before swallowing it.\n\nYou can go on a 3-day fruit fast to cleanse your body. Just eat fruits and drink fruit juice throughout the 3 days and you will be surprised when your friends tell you how radiant you look!\n\nKIWI: Tiny but mighty. This is a good source of potassium, magnesium, vitamin E & fiber. Its vitamin C content is twice that of an orange.\n\nAPPLE: An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Although an apple has a low vitamin C content, it has antioxidants & flavonoids which enhances the activity of vitamin C thereby helping to lower the risks of colon cancer, heart attack & stroke.\n\nSTRAWBERRY: Protective Fruit. Strawberries have the highest total antioxidant power among major fruits & protect the body from cancer-causing, blood vessel-clogging free radicals.\n\nORANGE: Sweetest medicine. Taking 2-4 oranges a day may help keep colds away, lower cholesterol, prevent & dissolve kidney stones as well as lessens the risk of colon cancer.\n\nWATERMELON: Coolest thirst quencher. Composed of 92% water, it is also packed with a giant dose of glutathione, which helps boost our immune system. They are also a key source of lycopene - the cancer fighting oxidant. Other nutrients found in watermelon are vitamin C & Potassium.\n\nGUAVA & PAPAYA: Top awards for vitamin C. They are the clear winners for their high vitamin C content. Guava is also rich in fiber, which helps prevent constipation. Papaya is rich in carotene; this is good for your\neyes.\n\nVariations: \u00a0 Versions in circulation in 2010 were titled \"Dr. Oz on Eating Fruit.\" There's no good reason to associate the television health pundit's name with the Internet-circulated piece, because Dr. Oz is not the author of the item, nor has he endorsed its claims about ingesting fruit only at specific times.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollected via e-mail, March 2009": [], "\"If you look at the number of illegal immigrants coming into the country, it is net zero.
